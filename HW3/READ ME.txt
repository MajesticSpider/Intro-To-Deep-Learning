This project consists of 2 sets of code
1) Trains RNN, LSTM, or GRU to predict the next character given text.
   * The dataset is a small text file which has been provided.
2) Trains LSTM or GRU to predict the next character given text.
   * The dataset is some text from Shakespeare and will be downloaded automatically.

Running The Code:
Make sure you have created the file structure shown below as if the folders do not exist,
it could create issues. Settings are at the top of each of the programs so you can easily
mess with the settings as you see fit.

├─ graphs/
│  ├─ sequence_prediction/
│  ├─ shakespeare_prediction/

├─ Shakespeare_prediction.py

For the sequence_prediction.py, if you change the text in sequence.txt, it will automatically
adjust to train off the new text instead.

Results:
When you run any of the code, training loss and other validation metrics will be recorded. 
Graphs will be generated and stored in the 'graphs' folder along with a .txt file that 
has the values at each epoch. The model will be saved to the 'model' folder after the codes
have finished.
