This project consists of 2 networks
1) Classifies CIFAR-1O images using only fully connected layers
2) Uses regression to determine price of selling a house based on a subset of input features.

Running The Code:
When running the regression code, only a subset of input features are actually being used. 
If you would like to use more features from .csv, simply add the names of the columns to 
the 'usefull_cols' list. Then, increase the number of input features by changing 'inputSize'
on line 25 to equal the new number of columns being used. Additionally, you'll need to 
increase 'inputSizeOneHotEncoding' to account for new columns being used.

Results:
When you run any of the code, training loss and other validation metrics will be recorded. 
Graphs will be generated and stored in the 'graphs' folder along with a .txt file that 
has the values at each epoch. The model will be saved to the 'model' folder after the codes
have finished.
