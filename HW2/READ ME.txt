This project consists of 2 networks
1) AlexNet which classifies the cifar 10 dataset
2) ResNet 18 which classifies the cifar 10 dataset

Running The Code:
Make sure you have created the file structure shown below as if the folders do not exist,
it could create issues. Settings are at the top of each of the programs so you can easily
mess with the settings as you see fit.

Results:
When you run any of the code, training loss and other validation metrics will be recorded. 
Graphs will be generated and stored in the 'graphs' folder along with a .txt file that 
has the values at each epoch. The model will be saved to the 'model' folder after the codes
have finished.
